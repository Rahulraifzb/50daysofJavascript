+ String can also be reversed by converting it to array, then joining it after reversing

## Challenges (0/3 done)

- [ ] reverseAString("JavaScript is awesome") should return "emosewa si tpircSavaJ"
- [ ] reverseAString("Peter Parker is Spiderman") should return "namredipS si rekraP reteP"
- [ ] reverseAString("codedamn") should return "nmadedoc"

``` 
    const str = "JavaScript is awesome";

    function reverseAString(str){
        // write your solution here

    }

    console.log(`Reversed string is: ${reverseAString(str)}`)
